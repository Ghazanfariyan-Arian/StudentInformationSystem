Title: Student Information System with CRUD REST APIs (Jersey 2.x)

Description:
This repository is dedicated to the development of a comprehensive Student Information System that exposes powerful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST APIs. In this project, we harness the capabilities of the Jersey 2.x library to construct these APIs. Unlike previous labs, this endeavor exclusively emphasizes the creation of the Model and Controller components of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

Key Features:

CRUD Operations: Learn how to design and implement RESTful endpoints that allow you to Create, Read, Update, and Delete student information. These APIs offer the backbone of a robust Student Information System, enabling seamless management of student data.

Jersey 2.x Integration: Explore the world of Jersey 2.x, a powerful framework for building RESTful web services. This library empowers you to design and expose APIs efficiently, promoting scalability and maintainability.

MVC Pattern: Focus on the Model and Controller components of the MVC architectural pattern. By decoupling data handling and application logic from the views, you lay a solid foundation for building scalable and modular web applications.

This project is an excellent opportunity to deepen your understanding of RESTful API design, the Jersey 2.x framework, and the principles of the MVC pattern. Dive into the world of web service development, and create a versatile and efficient Student Information System that can serve as a foundation for more complex applications.
